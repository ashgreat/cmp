Description: Estimation of conditional mixed process (CMP) models using maximum
    likelihood. CMP models allow for systems of equations with different model
    types including continuous (tobit-style), binary and ordered probit,
    and interval regression models. This is an R implementation based on
    David Roodman's Stata CMP package.
